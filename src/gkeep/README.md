# GKeep
This is a variation of [build your own google keep](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-keep#the-challenge---building-your-own-version-of-google-keep).

- To setup, use the virtual env: 
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Frogs is the name of the django project that should be keeping the whole code. Might later expand this to an ios and android app, using the frog service as backend.
